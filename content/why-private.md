title: Why are we doing this?

Hello private testers! If you're reading this you're helping us out with a private beta of a website version of AI News.

The main thesis is simply that AI needs its own "Hacker News of AI" community:

- HN has traffic but has [Eternal September problem](https://x.com/swyx/status/1821255709457314181)/ low key kinda hates AI
- Twitter has most news but feed is too ragebaity/confusing
- LessWrong has great technical community but has An Agenda
- /r/LocalLlama also great but mainly focused on open source models
- LinkedIn is too LinkedIn

In the immortal words of xkcd 927 (you know the one), all the other communities have issues so we will make our own supercommunity that has none!
